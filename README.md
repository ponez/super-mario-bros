# Dfq is this ?

Yet another stupid clone of super mario game in Js

## Installation (like what is wrong with you going to try this cancer?)

Use the package manager npm to fire up the game.

```bash
npm i
```
or
```bash
npm install
```

 i did used windows while making this so if you're using linux or whatever you might get capitalize problems, as you know windows is too retarded be case sensitive 
 
 
 after all of this run
```bash
npm run start
```
